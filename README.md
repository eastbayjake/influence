Background
==============
This project was a collaborative, open-source effort by a team of five engineers. We all had experienced the frustration of sorting through mounds of public data for interesting information, so we set out to make a government transparency app that focused on presenting a smaller set of data in a compelling way. You can read more about the project's evolution [here](http://watchdogscode.tumblr.com) or check out Influence posts on [my blog](http://eastbayjake.wordpress.com). 

My Contributions
===========
I took charge of Bill Search, Words Explorer, and some site-wide styling and design. We suffered some setbacks in Bill Search at the last minute -- the federal government blocked us from scraping bill text on the last day of feature development, which led to a last-minute scramble to replicate basic bill search functionality. We had to scrap a feature that would have let users annotate bills and share their findings with friends on social media. Despite the disappointment about cutting features, it was a great experience and I'm proud of what we produced in two weeks of hacking.

I'm especially proud of Words Explorer, which has yielded some interesting insights about the words legislators use. Our app lets users see the top words for a selected legislator, or search to see how often a word or phrase has been used in Congress since 1996. (You can see some of the most surprising facts [here](http://eastbayjake.wordpress.com/2013/08/24/influence-update-word-search/).)
